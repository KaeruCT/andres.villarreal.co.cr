*   ["Password Passthrough" Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/password-passthrough) - I made this Wordpress plugin for a company I worked at since they needed this very specific feature. However, I thought it could be useful to other people so I put it on the Wordpress plugin repository. Now it has over 400 active installs.

#### Other projects

I have built a few CRUD apps at work, school, and also a few command-line programs that I've incorporated into my daily workflow. If you take a look at my [Github](https://github.com/KaeruCT), you'll notice there are a lot of oddball projects that I've stopped working on. This is usually because I try to come up with silly projects in order to learn a new programming language or framework.

The projects below are projects I built on my own in my spare time. They are not your typical software application, but more like something I enjoyed programming purely for fun.
