About

I've been programming [since I was 12 years old](https://kaeruct.github.io/posts/origins.html). What I have learned so far can be summarized as "the less code the better".

Nonetheless I am a realist at heart, and I have learned to cope with gigantic codebases. One thing I like to do for fun is debugging through strange code written before I even graduated from high school.

In my spare time, I enjoy making and listening to music, playing old video games, and working on my own sideâ€‘projects. I'd love to show you all my music but no one ever seems to ask...
