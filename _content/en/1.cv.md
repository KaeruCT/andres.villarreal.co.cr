CV

I've been programming [since I was 12 years old](https://kaeruct.github.io/posts/origins.html). What I have learned so far can be summarized as "the less code the better".

Nonetheless I am a realist at heart, and I have learned to cope with gigantic codebases. One thing I like to do for fun is debugging through strange code written before I even graduated from high school.

In my spare time, I enjoy making and listening to music, playing old video games, and working on my own side‑projects. I'd love to show you all my music but no one ever seems to ask...
